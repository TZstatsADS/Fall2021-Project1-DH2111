### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Project title: Gender and Philosophy through the Ages
+ This project is conducted by Dan Harvey | dyh2111@columbia.edu

+ Project summary: As gender equality and respect of identity has become an important topic, I wanted to take a look at how gender plays a role in these philosopher's minds and throughout the ages, so I wanted to answer these simple questions by evaluating our data set against masculine, feminine, and neutral gender pronouns and their occurrences throughout the ages and by author.

I found myself asking the following questions:

- Does the use of feminine pronouns increase as the years go by?
- Does the use of masculine pronouns decrease as the years go by?
- Are certain authors more likely to use feminine, masculine, or neutral pronouns?

Following [suggestions](http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/) by [RICH FITZJOHN](http://nicercode.github.io/about/#Team) (@richfitz). This folder is orgarnized as follows.

### Data Source

The data source that we used in this project was downloaded here on September 23,2021: https://www.kaggle.com/kouroshalizadeh/history-of-philosophy.

### Methodolgy

We divided pronouns into 3 categories:

- Feminine: she, her, hers, herself, female, girl, women, woman
- Masculine: him, he, his, himself, male, boy, men, man
- Neutral: them, they, their

We then took note to see how often they were used with each author in their texts in the data set and the amount these were used over the years.

### Findings

This report was prepared with the following environmental settings.
```{r}
print(R.version)
```

# Load Libraries
library("tidyverse")
library("readr")
library("ggplot2")

#Make sure your working directory is set
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/Fall2021-Project1-DH2111")

#import raw data
philosophy_data <- read_csv("data/philosophy_data.csv", 
    col_types = cols(title = col_skip(), 
        sentence_spacy = col_skip(), sentence_str = col_skip(), 
        corpus_edition_date = col_skip(), 
        lemmatized_str = col_skip()))
        
#Set pronoun specifications
feminine  <- "she | her | hers | herself | female | girl | women | woman"
masculine <- "him | he | his | himself | male | boy | men | man"
neutral   <- "them | they | their"

#Subset data to only contain gender related
feminine_data<-philosophy_data%>%filter(grepl(feminine,sentence_lowered))
masculine_data<-philosophy_data%>%filter(grepl(masculine,sentence_lowered))
neutral_data<-philosophy_data%>%filter(grepl(neutral,sentence_lowered))
  
rowsByGender <- data.frame(Gender = c("Masculine", "Feminine", "Neutral"),
                 Entries = c(nrow(masculine_data), nrow(feminine_data), nrow(neutral_data)))
```
## Preliminary Overview

First, Lets take an overall look at how the whole dataset is divided upon 3 camps of gender references: 

- Feminine
- Masculine
- Neutral

```{r}
ggplot(rowsByGender, aes(x=Gender, y = Entries)) +  
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = c("blue", "pink", "purple"))
```


We immediately see that Masculine and Neutral references are orders of magnitudes greater represented in these texts.
